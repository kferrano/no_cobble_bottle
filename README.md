# No Cobblemon Bottle Return (Forge 1.20.1)

Stops Cobblemon from returning an empty **Glass Bottle** when using medicine via the Cobblemon UI.  
Prevents the add entirely → no hotbar flicker. Other bottles (brewing/loot/crafting) are unaffected.

## Requirements
- Minecraft **1.20.1**
- Forge **47.x**
- Cobblemon **1.5.2** (1.20.1)

## Install
Drop the JAR into `mods/` (server and/or client). Launch.

## What it changes
- Blocks the inventory insertion for the Cobblemon medicine bottle return path.
- Does not touch any other source of glass bottles.

## Compatibility
- Loader: Forge
- Game: 1.20.1
- Cobblemon: 1.5.2
- Works alongside other mods. If a heavily modified Cobblemon fork changes the call path, open an issue.
